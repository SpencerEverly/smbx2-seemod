This is a mod of the original SMBX2 LunaLua architecture. It does many things:

- Compatibility to change the window title (Misc) and icon (loadIconImgResolved)
- Adding loadscreen sound support with loadscreen.ogg in the episode folder
- Adds online capibilities
- And more that isn't on this list

For documentation, see below.

-------DOCUMENTATION-------

(Field types, aka things that the code does that indicates what it does)
word: Can be a number (Like 0, or 1)
bool: This, or that. which is really true or false (Think of a true or false quiz)
float: Timing and speed, I think
"string": A string, which is a word or a sentence in quotes ("")
..optional: Optional argument, specific for something

----Functions----

VER_SEE_MOD - This is the SMBX version that's being used. Use `if SMBX_VERSION == VER_SEE_MOD then` to detect the version. Useful for breaking SEE Mod-only commands and SMBX2's commands apart.

----Misc----

Misc.setWindowTitle("string") - Sets the window title of the SMBX game into any title.
Misc.setWindowIcon("string/to/file.extension") - Loads an image as an icon in the episode folder and replaces it with the window icon. loadImageResolved is recommended.
Misc.setWindowPosition(x, y) - Sets the main game window position to any position on the screen.
Misc.toggleWindowFocus(bool) - Whenever to focus or unfocus the window when not focused on the game, setting bool as true or false.
