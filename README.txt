This version of SMBX2 is actually a bit different compared to the mainline version. This version enables online things such as online multiplayer (Experimental), and reenabled os.rename/os.remove.

To use this, extract and overwrite everything in your SMBX2 folder, or you can seperately use this on a clean install overwriting those files.
