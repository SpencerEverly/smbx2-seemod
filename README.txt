This version of SMBX2 is actually a bit different compared to the mainline version. This version does the following:

- Enables online support (Experimental)
- Fixes GIF Recording crashing from the latest LunaLua commits
- Adds Misc.setWindowTitle and Misc.setWindowIcon commands by MrDoubleA

To use this, reinstall SMBX2 onto a different folder and extract and overwrite everything into the seperate SMBX2 folder.
