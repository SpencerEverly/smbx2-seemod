This version of SMBX2 is actually a bit different compared to the mainline version. This version does the following:

- Enables online support (Experimental)
- Reenables os.rename/os.remove
- Fixes GIF Recording crashing (Coming soon)
- Redoes Defines to support player2 (Coming soon)

To use this, extract and overwrite everything in your SMBX2 folder, or you can seperately use this on a clean install overwriting those files.

(The only problem this has is that it crashes with recording GIFs, which will be fixes in the future, but other than that, everything works as intended)
