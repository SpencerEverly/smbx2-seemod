This version of SMBX2 is actually a bit different compared to the mainline version. This version does the following:

- Enables socket (Local online support)
- Updates SDL Mixer X to the latest version
- Adds Misc.setWindowTitle and Misc.setWindowIcon commands by MrDoubleA
- Add some new Misc functions (Misc.setWindowPosition, Misc.toggleWindowFocus) by me
- Adds some new Audio functions (Audio.MusicReset, etc.)

To use this, reinstall SMBX2 onto a different folder and extract and overwrite everything into the seperate SMBX2 folder (Or replace your own install, whichever you feel is the best).

For more information about what all this does, see the Documentation txt file on the root of this directory.
