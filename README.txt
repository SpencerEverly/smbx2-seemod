This version of SMBX2 is actually a bit different compared to the mainline version. This version does the following:

- Enables online support (Experimental)
- Fixes GIF Recording crashing from the latest LunaLua commits
- Adds Misc.setWindowTitle and Misc.setWindowIcon commands by MrDoubleA
- Add some new Misc commands (Misc.setWindowPosition, Misc.toggleWindowFocus) by me

To use this, reinstall SMBX2 onto a different folder and extract and overwrite everything into the seperate SMBX2 folder.
