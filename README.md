# SMBX2 LunaLua SEE Mod
An SMBX2 mod made by me, Spencer Everly. Highly experimental, and not recommended for release (Yet).
## Why was this made?
I edited the original LunaLua to add certain features to make SMAS++ it's own thing, such as implementing the loading sound even earlier than onLoad (Where it first starts the loading screen), adding save management features, and a couple of other things.
## This isn't secure if it can delete and rename anything!
Hey, I didn't omit os.execute. That should be enough to say it doesn't do any harm. os.rename and os.remove are commands that can be manually executed, and should ONLY be used for things like save data management, or profile picture managment (Which I'm considering, but idk yet)
## What will happen to SMAS++ if it becomes it's own prepackaged game?
It will be it's own project along with Where SMB Attacks, and other SMBX2 episodes to add if I ever make them/put them in. This might mean that it will be incompatible with original SMBX2 installs if it uses up new commands that only the SEE Mod adds.
## Why is this repostitory private?
For security reasons with os.rename/os.remove, until I lock it down to only certain extensions, this is why.
