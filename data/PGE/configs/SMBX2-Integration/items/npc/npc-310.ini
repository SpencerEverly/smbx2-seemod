description = "A special coin that rewards the player with 4000 points. When collected, it is permanently saved to the current save file. The number of <b>Star Coins</b> collected can be tracked through the game's HUD. Index corresponds to the order the Star Coins are to be obtained in the level. Star Coins can only display in the HUD if their index is set to be greater than zero and if there are no gaps in indices when counting from 1. E.g. in order to place a Star Coin with Index 3, there have to be Star Coins with Indices 1 and 2."
